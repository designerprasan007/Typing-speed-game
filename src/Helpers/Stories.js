    story: "I let myself in after ringing the doorbell one time. At most homes I wouldn’t do this; I’d just leave the groceries on the front stoop. But I decide to waltz right into Mr. Granger’s house for a few reasons. One: he always leaves the front door unlocked, which he argues is intentional, and I retort that he is becoming forgetful in his old age."

    story: "Once upon a time, a princess lived trapped in a tower, where her hair grew very, very long. Only, not the stylish kind of long-the flowing, wavy mermaid tresses-but quadruple-split ends that crackled like dead flower stems when you touched them, because that’s really what happens when someone lives trapped in a tower without a haircut. The longer the princess stayed in the tower, the longer her hair grew. The distance between her good hair days also grew. It was either too frizzy or too oily, so that the princess started to feel more like a crone."

    story: "I agonized over whether I should pick 'Rip Van Winkle” or 'The Legend of Sleepy Hollow” from Irving’s oeuvre. Both have many, many adaptations to their name and are so ubiquitous as to have drifted into the folklore realm. The latter certainly has more memorable recent adaptations, but the former is the only one with a bridge named after it. Ah, screw it, we’ll count them both."

    story: "Poe’s early stream-of-consciousness horror story, unreliable narrator and heart beating under the floorboards and all, is certainly one of the most adapted-and even more often referenced-short stories in popular culture, and which may or may not be the source for all of the hundreds of stories in which a character is tormented by a sound only they can hear.

    story:"Once, while I was walking in Brooklyn, carrying my Bartleby tote bag, a woman in an SUV pulled over (on Atlantic Avenue, folks) to excitedly wave at me and yell 'Melville! That’s Melville!” Which is all you really need to know about that.",

    story:"I will leave it to Kurt Vonnegut, who famously wrote, 'I consider anybody a twerp who hasn’t read the greatest American short story, which is 'Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge,” by Ambrose Bierce. It isn’t remotely political. It is a flawless example of American genius, like 'Sophisticated Lady” by Duke Ellington or the Franklin stove.”"

    story:"Odds are this was the first overtly Feminist text you ever read, at least if you’re of a certain age; it’s become a stand-in for the idea of women being driven insane by the patriarchy-and being ignored by doctors, who deem them 'hysterical.” This is another one with lots of adaptations to its name, including a memorable episode of The Twilight Zone, which concludes: 'Next time you’re alone, look quickly at the wallpaper, and the ceiling, and the cracks on the sidewalk. Look for the patterns and lines and faces on the wall. Look, if you can, for Sharon Miles, visible only out of the corner of your eye or… in the Twilight Zone.”",

    story:"Technically a novella, but discussed enough as a story that I’ll include it here (same goes for a couple of others on this list, including 'The Metamorphosis'). It has, as a work of literature, inspired a seemingly endless amount of speculation, criticism, unpacking, and stance-taking. 'In comment after comment, article after article, the evidence has been sifted through and judgments delivered,” Brad Leithauser wrote in The New Yorker. Fine, intelligent readers have confirmed the validity of the ghosts (Truman Capote); equally fine and intelligent readers have thunderously established the governess’s madness (Edmund Wilson).” And nothing that inspires so much interpretive interest could escape the many interpretations into other media: films, episodes of television, and much other literature."

    story:"Widely acknowledged as one of Chekhov’s best stories, if not the best, and therefore almost no students get through their years at school without reading it. Has been adapted as a film, a ballet, a play, a musical, and most importantly, a Joyce Carol Oates short story."

    story: "According to Wikipedia, there have been 17 different film adaptations of O. Henry’s classic short story about a couple’s thwarted Christmas; the essential format-Della sells her hair to buy Jim a watch chain; Jim sells his watch to buy Della a set of combs-has been referenced and replicated countless times beyond that. I even heard Dax Shepard refer to this story on his podcast the other day, and so I rest my case."
